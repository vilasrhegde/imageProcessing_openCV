# Image Processing
> A tensorflow practice to process the images into array

## Prerequisites
- matplotlib
- openCV
- PIL (Pillow library)

## How?
- Read the image by link or directly by name
- Make sure it is in numpy array
- Display the image from numpy array for checking
- Resize the image by pillow
- Save the resized image
- Convert RGB to Greyscale using openCV. Why because RGB requires lot of processing to identify any object. In our case colors are not important.
- Get the final greyscaled image
